# Zero To Dev (Server Side) 💻

> Simple learning platform built with React and Redux.

I built this application to help people who want to learn web development. It gives the user a roadmap of what he needs to learn and in which order.

# Quick Start 🚀

Install the dependencies:

```bash
    yarn install
```

Create an `.env` file in the `root` directory with the following values:

```bash
    GUEST_DB_PASSWORD=CpqZxfF4NNBSMIoC
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=3g5Ck43ZcfXA
    PORT=5000
```

# Notes On The Database 📁

I provided the password of the `guest` user of the database, so you can only **read the data (of all databases) and insert data in users and notes databases**. With this you have everything that you need to make the application works.
